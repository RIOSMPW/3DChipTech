# 2.5D Package

## EMIB of Intel
The concept is similar to that of a 2.5D package, but it differs in that there is no TSV. As a result, EMIB technology has the benefits of standard package yield, no additional process, and simple design.

## CoWoS of TSMC
CoWoS technology from TSMC is also a 2.5D packaging technology. There are three kinds of intermediate layers: CoWoS S uses Si substrate as the intermediate layer, CoWoS R uses RDL as the intermediate layer, and CoWoS L uses Chiplet and RDL as the intermediate layer.

The TSMC InFO (2D) and CoWoS (2.5D) differ in that CoWoS is aimed at the high-end market and has a greater number of wires and a larger package size. InFO for the cost-effective market, the package size is small, as is the number of connections.

The first-generation CoWoS is primarily employed in large FPGAs. CoWoS-1â€™s middle layer chip area is approximately 800 mm2, which is very close to the mask limit. Through mask splicing, the second-generation CoWoS significantly expands the size of the intermediate layer. TSMC initially met the 1200mm2 requirement but has since increased the intermediate layer size to 1700mm2. CoWoS-XL2 is the name given to these large packages.

TSMC recently announced that the number of transistors in the fifth generation of CoWoS-S will be increased by 20 times, as will the area of the intermediate layer. In addition, the fifth generation package technology will include eight 128GB HBM2e RAM modules and two large SoC cores.

XDFOI-of-JCET
It performs better, is more reliable, and is less expensive than 2.5D TSV packaging technology. The system can implement a multi-layer wiring layer with a line distance or online width of up to 2um. Additionally, the package size is enormous and the extremely tiny pitch convex block interconnection technique is used. This allows for the integration of numerous chips, high bandwidth memory, and passive devices.

The I, X, R, and H-Cube advanced packages from Samsung are just a few examples. The I-Cube from Samsung also comes in 2.5D.
