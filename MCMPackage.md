A multi-chip module (MCM) is an electronic package consisting of multiple integrated circuits (ICs) assembled into a single device. An MCM works as a single component and is capable of handling an entire function. The various components of a MCM are mounted on a substrate, and the bare dies of the substrate are connected to the surface via wire bonding, tape bonding or flip-chip bonding. The module can be encapsulated by a plastic molding and is mounted on the printed circuit board. MCMs offer better performance and can reduce the size of a device considerably.
