# 3D and 2.5D Package Technology（Chiplet Technology）
3D and 2.5D Package Technology refers to advanced packaging techniques used in the semiconductor industry. These technologies enable the integration of multiple components or dies into a single package, resulting in increased functionality and performance.

In 3D packaging, multiple dies are stacked vertically, interconnected using through-silicon vias (TSVs) or microbumps. This vertical integration allows for shorter interconnect lengths, reduced power consumption, and improved thermal management. 3D packaging is commonly used in applications such as high-performance computing, graphics processing units (GPUs), and memory modules.

On the other hand, 2.5D packaging involves the integration of multiple dies on a silicon interposer. The interposer acts as a bridge, providing electrical connections between the dies. This technology allows for the combination of different types of dies, such as processors, memory, and sensors, in a single package. 2.5D packaging offers improved performance, power efficiency, and system miniaturization.


Both 3D and 2.5D package technologies have revolutionized the semiconductor industry by enabling the development of smaller, faster, and more power-efficient electronic devices. These packaging techniques play a crucial role in the advancement of various fields, including mobile devices, automotive electronics, and data centers.

This repository will provide a comprehensive and detailed introduction to the technology behind 3D and 2.5D packaging. It will cover various aspects such as the principles, applications, and advancements in this field. Additionally, it will explore the benefits and challenges associated with these technologies.This comprehensive guide aims to equip designers with the knowledge and insights needed to navigate the exciting world of 3D and 2.5D package technology.

## Benifits from 3D and 2.5D Package Technology

**Significantly reduce the size of the encapsulated chip**

Whether it is the encapsulation of multiple chips or the wafer-level encapsulation of a single chip, it can significantly reduce the size of the package to decrease the footprint of the entire system board. Utilizing packaging methods to shrink the chip area is more cost-effective than improving the front-end process.

**Accommodate more I/O ports for chips**

With the introduction of front-end process methods, we can use RDL technology to accommodate more I/O pins on a unit area of the chip, thus reducing waste of chip area.

**Lower chip manufacturing costs**

With the introduction of the chiplet approach, it becomes relatively easy to encapsulate multiple chips with different functions, process technologies/nodes together to form a system integration chip (SIP). This avoids the need for all functions and IPs to adopt the same (highest) cost method.

**Enhance interconnectivity between chips**

With the increasing demand for high computing power, in many application scenarios, there is a need for a significant amount of data exchange between computing units (CPU, GPU, etc.) and DRAM. This often results in almost half of the system's performance and power consumption being wasted on information exchange. Now, through various 2.5D/3D packaging methods, we can connect processors and DRAM as closely as possible, reducing this loss to less than 20%, thus significantly reducing the cost of computation. This efficiency improvement far exceeds the progress brought by adopting more advanced manufacturing processes.

**Ecosystem Wants to be Free**

By David A. Patterson · Director of RIOS Lab

**RISC-V International Open Source Laboratory** (RIOS Lab) is a Shenzhen-based research facility focused on computer system architecture, supported by the Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Research Institute. As an Open Source and Nobel Prize Laboratory, RIOS Lab promotes open-source innovation and collaboration. Our philosophy is that the computer architecture ecosystem should be free for all to access and build upon.

In November 2019, RIOS Lab was officially unveiled. Under the leadership of 2017 A.M. Turing Award winner Prof. David A. Patterson and operational support from TBSI,  RIOS Lab will conduct cutting-edge research in RISC-V hardware and software technology. Patterson first proposed the Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC), an open and free instruction set architecture enabling a new era of processor innovation through open standard collaboration. Released in 2010, the latest Fifth Generation RISC has gained worldwide attention.

The name for the lab RIOS is also inspired by the Spanish word for “rivers.” It symbolizes the flow of information from many sources, coming together to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.
