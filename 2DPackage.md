# 2D Package

Currently, in the field of advanced packaging, there are three main types that can be distinguished: 2D packaging, 2.5D packaging, and 3D packaging. Each type has its own unique characteristics and applications, offering a wide range of possibilities for various industries. Through continuous research and development, these packaging techniques have evolved to meet the ever-growing demands of modern technology.

2D Packing is a computational problem that involves fitting a set of 2D objects into a container of fixed dimensions in the most efficient way possible. The goal is to minimize wastage of space and optimize the arrangement of objects.

Two important factors for categorizing electronic integration technologies are

 1. Physical structure

All chips and passive devices are physically installed on the substrate plane. The XY plane is in direct contact with chips and passive devices. Substrate wiring and holes are located below the XY plane

 2. Electrical connection (electrical interconnection)

All electrical connections must pass through the substrate (except for very few bonding points directly connected by bonding wire)

The chip integration primarily follows a 2D approach, where the transistors are integrated into the wafer plane. Similarly, PCB integration also follows a 2D approach, where electronic components are mounted flat on the PCB surface. Therefore, both chip and PCB integration can be considered as 2D integration. However, in-package integration presents a more complex scenario.
